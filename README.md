Here is a captivating README.md for your new Arduino project:

# Arduino Speed Control

This Arduino project demonstrates a basic LED control concept using a potentiometer. The intensity of three LEDs is controlled based on the potentiometer's position, creating a simple yet effective interactive light display.

## Code Explanation

The provided C++ code utilizes the Arduino framework to control three LEDs based on the input from a potentiometer. Here is a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

- **Declarations:**
  - `ledPin1`, `ledPin2`, `ledPin3`: Digital pins connected to the LEDs.
  - `potpin`: Analog pin connected to the potentiometer.
  - `val`: Variable to store the potentiometer value.

- **Setup Function:**
  - Initializes the LED pins as output.

- **Loop Function:**
  - Reads the value from the potentiometer.
  - Maps the potentiometer value to a range suitable for controlling the LEDs.
  - Controls the state of the LEDs based on the mapped potentiometer value.
  - Adds delays to ensure smooth operation and transition.

## Circuit Diagram

Connect the LEDs and the potentiometer to your Arduino as follows:
- `ledPin1` to pin 12
- `ledPin2` to pin 11
- `ledPin3` to pin 10
- Potentiometer to analog pin A0
